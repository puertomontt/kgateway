// publishGate bounds how long per-client publication may be withheld while
// referenced clusters are unready. Unreadiness is not guaranteed to converge
// (#14352) — a plugin can contribute an EDS cluster whose endpoints row
// never appears, and translation backlog can stretch "briefly behind" past
// any probe window — so every withhold needs a bound. The gate owns two,
// governed by the same budget (KGW_PER_CLIENT_PUBLISH_BUDGET; 0 disables
// both):
//
//   - first publish (offerColdLocked/firePending): how long a client that
//     has NEVER been published a snapshot waits for its referenced clusters
//     to become ready;
//   - flip release (publishHeldLocked/fireFlipRelease): how long a held
//     route flip may pin the client's route/listener/secret updates at their
//     published versions while a newly-referenced cluster stays unready.
//
// First publish: the per-cluster resolution (resolveDeferred) withholds a
// deferred snapshot from a never-published client — there is no last-good
// config to hold or carry, and publishing routes to unready clusters would
// 503 them.
// That is correct for the brief converging case, but with no bound a
// permanently-unready reference leaves the pod with no listeners at all — it
// never reports Ready and crash-loops, and each restart reconnects as a new
// client that re-triggers the per-client fan-out. So the gate arms one timer
// per never-published client. If the client's inputs cohere within the
// budget, the coherent publish wins and the timer is discarded. At expiry the
// latest deferred snapshot is published as-is — it is always internally
// consistent (missing EDS references carry synthesized empty assignments), so
// the pod binds its listeners and becomes Ready while routes to still-unready
// clusters return 503 until they cohere.
//
// One exception: a client that reported a prior accepted xDS version on
// connect is warm — an Envoy that reconnected (or outlived a controller
// restart) and is still serving config from its previous stream. Publishing
// a snapshot whose routes name clusters absent from its CDS would replace
// that working config with one that NCs those routes, so warm clients stay
// withheld while any referenced cluster is MISSING (the #13868
// make-before-break property). A controller-local cache miss alone cannot
// prove a client is cold; the client-reported version can.
//
// The warm withhold deliberately does NOT extend to gaps that are only
// underived CLAs (missingEndpointsReferenced). syncXds events only fire
// after the informer chain has synced (krt registration semantics), so a CLA
// still underived a full budget later is either pathological backlog or a
// plugin that never derives endpoints for its EDS cluster — states with no
// convergence guarantee. Withholding on them would freeze the warm client
// indefinitely after a controller restart — no route change, cert rotation,
// or endpoint update would ever reach it — and would starve any cold pod
// that shares its UCC key (the prior-version mark is key-level). So at
// expiry, if every referenced cluster is present in CDS, the snapshot
// publishes with the synthesized empties as the best-known state; if the gap
// was lag after all, the very next build repairs it through per-cluster
// resolution (the cache is populated from here on).
//
// Flip release: resolveDeferredPerCluster holds routes/listeners/secrets at
// their published versions while a route flip targets a newly-referenced
// cluster that is not yet ready. The hold is per resource type, so while it
// lasts EVERY route/listener/secret update for the client is pinned — fine
// for a backend whose translation or endpoints catch up in seconds, but a
// reference that never resolves (a plugin that contributes an EDS cluster
// with no endpoints source; a cluster that never reaches CDS) would pin
// them forever. So the first held publish of an episode arms a release timer; if
// the client is still holding at expiry, the latest held wrapper is
// re-resolved with holds disabled and published: the flip goes out, routes
// to still-unready clusters fail until those clusters become ready — the
// truthful steady-state answer — and pinned updates resume. Repeated holds
// refresh the pending wrapper but do not extend the deadline; the episode
// ends when a publish without a hold goes out.
//
// All snapshot-cache mutations for gated clients go through the gate's lock,
// so an expiring timer can never overwrite a newer publish.
