# Scoping cluster discovery to what routes reference

By default kgateway sends every proxy a CDS cluster, and an EDS
`ClusterLoadAssignment`, for **every** backend in its discovery scope, whether or
not any route targets it. A cluster with 300 Services and 16 routed ones puts all
300 in every proxy's `config_dump`, in every proxy replica's memory, and in every
proxy's `/stats` — where each cluster contributes a large family of series
carrying an `envoy_cluster_name` label.

`KGW_CLUSTER_DISCOVERY_MODE=REFERENCED` scopes CDS and EDS to the clusters the
generated configuration actually references. It is off by default.

## Why the default is emit-all

This is not an oversight. Emitting everything is what makes a route retarget
safe.

For `/foo: service-a -> service-b`, the route update (RDS) and the cluster
update (CDS) reach Envoy as separate events. If `/foo` starts naming `service-b`
before `service-b`'s cluster exists, `/foo` returns `503 NC` for the gap.
Pre-creating a cluster for every Service guarantees the destination is always
already there. Emit-all is a make-before-break workaround for not having safe
cluster and route transitions.

Scoping therefore has to supply those transitions, in both directions.

## What counts as referenced

The emitted set is derived from the **generated Envoy configuration**, not from
route `backendRefs`. That is correct by construction for every destination
translation actually chose, and it picks up delegation, non-HTTP routes and
mirrors for free, because they are already in the output.

It deliberately over-approximates. The collector takes every string of every
message it reaches, including inside `typed_config`, rather than reading named
fields of message types it knows about. Emitting one cluster nothing uses costs
a little memory; failing to emit one Envoy needs is a permanent outage with no
route-level symptom. Ancillary clusters — ext_authz and ext_proc servers, rate
limit services, access-log gRPC sinks, JWKS sources — are real clusters reached
only from filter configuration, and they are exactly the population a narrower
collector would drop.

A golden-corpus sweep enforces this: for every translator fixture, every cluster
the configuration mentions must be in the emitted set, checked against an oracle
that walks the fixture YAML rather than production code.

## Transitions

**Adding a destination.** Publishing the new cluster and the route that names it
in one coherent snapshot is not enough, because Envoy does not necessarily apply
CDS before RDS within a snapshot, and after a CDS response is sent its watch
stays closed until Envoy ACKs — so a route update landing in that window reaches
the wire on the still-open RDS watch, ahead of its destination.
`KGW_CLUSTER_REFERENCE_AHEAD` holds routes, listeners and secrets at the
versions the client already has while the new cluster goes out, then releases.

**Removing a destination.** Envoy is delivered CDS before RDS, so dropping a
cluster in the same snapshot as the route that stopped naming it sends the
removal first. `KGW_CLUSTER_DEREFERENCE_GRACE` keeps the cluster published for a
bounded period after its last reference goes away, so the route update always
lands first. Set this above worst-case RDS propagation for your fleet. Connections
on a removed or changed listener keep using it for Envoy's listener drain time
(600s by default), so a window shorter than the drain time can remove a cluster
those draining connections still route to; size it to cover the drain time if
that matters for your traffic.

Ordered ADS does not substitute for either window: it fixes CDS before RDS,
which is the wrong order for removals, and it does not close the ACK-skew
window for additions.

## When scoping turns itself off

A route can pick its destination at request time — from a header, or from a
cluster specifier plugin whose script composes a name — out of a set the
configuration never enumerates. No walk over the generated protos can find those
candidates.

Such a gateway reverts to emitting every cluster, and
`kgateway_xds_cluster_scoping_disabled_gateways` goes to 1 for it. Detection
matters more than it looks: a plugin like that usually falls back when its
computed cluster is absent, so pruning a candidate does not produce a visible
503 — every affected request quietly goes somewhere else instead. The metric is
what turns that into something you can alert on.

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KGW_CLUSTER_DISCOVERY_MODE` | `ALL` | `REFERENCED` scopes CDS/EDS to referenced clusters. `ALL` is the pre-existing behavior. |
| `KGW_CLUSTER_DEREFERENCE_GRACE` | `5s` | How long a de-referenced cluster stays published. `0` removes immediately and accepts the race. |
| `KGW_CLUSTER_REFERENCE_AHEAD` | `2s` | How long a route update onto a newly-emitted cluster is held. `0` publishes both together and accepts the blip. |

Both windows are ignored in `ALL` mode, where no cluster is ever de-referenced
and none is ever new to a client. With `ALL` set, nothing in this feature runs:
the emitted set is not computed, no filtering happens, and the publish path is
the one that existed before the feature.

The reference-ahead hold is additionally bounded by
`KGW_PER_CLIENT_PUBLISH_BUDGET`, so a misconfigured window cannot pin a client's
routing updates.

## Metrics

| Metric | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kgateway_xds_cluster_scoping_emitted_clusters` | gauge | Backend clusters published to a client after scoping. |
| `kgateway_xds_cluster_scoping_dropped_clusters` | gauge | Clusters withheld because nothing references them. |
| `kgateway_xds_cluster_scoping_disabled_gateways` | gauge | 1 when a gateway reverted to emit-all. Worth an alert. |
| `kgateway_xds_cluster_scoping_transitions_total` | counter | Emitted-set changes that needed a window, by `transition`. |

`dropped_clusters` at zero with scoping on means the deployment routes to
everything it discovers and has nothing to gain here. A high ratio of
`transitions_total{transition="reference_ahead_held"}` to route updates means
most route edits are paying the hold, which is a reason to shorten the window
rather than a fault.

## What changes for users

Unreferenced Services stop appearing as clusters in `config_dump` and stop
producing `/stats` series. That is the point, and it is also a visible behavior
change for anyone whose dashboards assume those clusters exist — which is why
the feature is opt-in.
